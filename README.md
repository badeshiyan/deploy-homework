DEPLOYED HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT:

Overview:
This project involved the editing and overall improvement of the client's source code. Although the submitted code generates the intended web page, the changes made allowed for a more effective and cleaner code. This homework assignment includes HTML and CSS basics that we've covered thus far in our four class sessions. These include semantic HTML elements (opposed to div or more generic tags), the organization and consolidation of redundant CSS selectors and properties and its structure, the inclusion of code comments that were not initially included, among other coding basics.
