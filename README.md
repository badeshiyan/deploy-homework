### deploy-homework - DEPLOYED HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT:

## Overview:

Upon review of this project, the reader will find the editing and overall improvement of the submitted, client's source code. Although the submitted code generates the intended web page, the changes made to the html document allowed for a more effective and optimized code. Please note that in addition to the optimization of the html source code, the redundancies of the css style sheet were removed as well; the css included repeated information that was, again, deleted to make for a more efficient css.

This effort includes HTML and CSS basics that we've covered thus far in our four class sessions. These include the usage of semantic HTML elements (opposed to div or more generic tags), the organization and consolidation of redundant CSS selectors and properties and its structure, the inclusion of code comments that were not initially included, among other coding basics.
